How to create/modify/copy/move files or directory with name containing mathematical evaluations

There are times when we need to create directories or files with their names containing some parameter values. For example, you may wish to create a directory that contains output of a scientific program with some parameter *\alpha = 100* and *\alpha = 200*, or files with two parameter *a=40, b=0.5* and *a=30, b= 0.75*, or may be file names that contains the mathematical evaluations of these parameters *\alpha, a, b* e.g. "file_sin(\alpha)_exp(a)_exp(b).txt"

This shell script does an exemplary task. You will get the ideas soon if you closely look at the file `copyme.bash`

The output of of this shell script is given below.
